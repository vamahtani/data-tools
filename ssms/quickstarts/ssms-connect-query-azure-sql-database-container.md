# Quickstart: Connect and query an Azure SQL Database container using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

[!INCLUDE [asdb](../includes/applies-to-version/asdb.md)]

<!-- Release review: Confirm the November 17, 2026 public preview publication timing and exact SSMS build availability. Wizard steps and screenshots are based on the supplied November 8, 2026 SSMS 22 walkthrough. -->

Create a local Azure SQL Database container by using the SSMS provisioning wizard, then connect and run Transact-SQL (T-SQL) commands. You don't need to write container startup commands. The container is free for local development and testing and doesn't require an Azure subscription or credit card.

The SSMS container provisioning wizard supports **Azure SQL Database containers only**, not SQL Server containers. This SSMS workflow supports **Windows x64**. ARM devices aren't supported for this workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure SQL Database container is in public preview. 

This quickstart demonstrates the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create and start a local Azure SQL Database container with the SSMS wizard
> - Connect to the container in SSMS
> - Create a database and connect directly to it
> - Create a table, insert rows, and query the results
> - Verify the database and engine identity
> - Clean up the local resources

## What is an Azure SQL Database container?

A container packages the Azure SQL Database engine so that a container runtime can run it on your computer. Your application connects to a local address such as `127.0.0.1,1433`, rather than an Azure SQL logical server.

The container runs the Azure SQL Database engine, not the SQL Server container image. It supports Azure SQL Database T-SQL and the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol used by SQL drivers. `SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns `5`, identifying the Azure SQL Database engine. Native vectors, vector search, and JSON let you explore AI-ready data scenarios locally.

The container doesn't provide the managed cloud service. Azure-managed backups, high availability, elastic pools, and serverless auto-pause are cloud capabilities, not local container features. For more information, see [What is the Azure SQL Database container?](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/what-is-the-container.html).

## Choose your development database

| Option | Choose it when | Cost and account requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure SQL Database container through SSMS | You want to learn SQL or build and test an application targeting Azure SQL Database locally on Windows x64. | Free for local development and testing. No Azure subscription or credit card required. |
| Azure SQL Database in Azure | You need a managed database, cloud integration, or a cloud validation environment. | Requires an Azure subscription. The [Azure SQL Database free offer](/azure/azure-sql/database/free-offer) has separate eligibility requirements and usage allowances. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure SQL Database containers are for development, testing, CI, and demos, not production. For production, deploy your application and database to Azure SQL Database in Azure. The free local container and the Azure SQL Database free offer are separate options.

## Prerequisites

- [Install SQL Server Management Studio](../install/install.md) 22 on a supported **Windows x64** computer. Use a build that includes **Create Azure SQL Database container (Preview)**.
- Install and start a container runtime that runs Linux containers. For Docker Desktop, use the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) backend. See [Docker Desktop installation on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/). The wizard checks runtime installation, engine state, Linux container mode, and available resources.
- The wizard requires at least 2 GB of memory and one processor available to the container engine. For local development, allocate at least 4 GB of memory and two CPU cores, and keep at least 10 GB of free disk space for the image and a small database.
- Make a local TCP port available for the database connection. This quickstart uses `1433`; use your actual host port if it differs.
- Have internet access for the initial image download. After the image is cached, local queries don't require a cloud database. External AI endpoints and other online services still require connectivity.

For engine resource requirements, see [container prerequisites](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/prerequisites.html). The engine's broader platform support doesn't change the Windows x64-only scope of the SSMS container provisioning experience. ARM isn't supported for this SSMS workflow.

## Create an Azure SQL Database container

Use the SSMS wizard to create and start the container. The wizard provisions an Azure SQL Database container; there isn't a SQL Server container option in this SSMS experience.

1. In the **Object Explorer** toolbar, select **Create Azure SQL Database container (Preview)**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/create-container.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Object Explorer toolbar with Create Azure SQL Database container (Preview) highlighted.":::

1. On **Overview**, review the prerequisites and local development guidance, then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Overview page describing runtime requirements and container database storage.":::

   > [!WARNING]
   > Databases created by this wizard are stored inside the container. Deleting the container permanently removes those databases. Export any schema and data you need before deleting it.

1. On **Runtime readiness**, wait for the runtime checks to complete. If a check fails, resolve the reported problem and select **Check again**. When the page reports that the container runtime is ready, select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/runtime-readiness.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Runtime readiness page reporting that the container runtime is ready to create the container.":::

1. On **Container settings**, enter end confirm a password for the built-in `sa` login. The password must contain at least eight characters and include characters from at least three of these categories: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

   Select Remember password if you want SSMS to save the password in connection history. Otherwise, keep the password securely available for future connections. Don't store it in source control or include it in AI prompts.

   Review **View license terms**, then select the license acceptance checkbox. Expand **Advanced options** if you need to review additional configuration. Select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/container-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container settings with Azure SQL Database selected, masked SA password fields, Remember password, license acceptance, and Create.":::

1. On **Provisioning**, wait while SSMS verifies runtime readiness, downloads the image, creates and starts the container, waits for the engine, and connects Object Explorer.

   When the page reports **The container is ready and connected in Object Explorer**, expand **Connection String Details** to review the local connection information. Record the actual server endpoint and host port for application connections. Select **Close**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/provisioning-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Provisioning with all steps completed and the container connected in Object Explorer.":::

The wizard saves a secure local connection and opens it in Object Explorer. A running container, a connection, and a user database are different resources. Continue with [Create a database](#create-a-database) to create your application database.

<!-- Screenshot placeholder: Add an expanded Advanced options screenshot and an expanded Connection String Details screenshot when available. The supplied walkthrough shows these sections collapsed; don't infer their fields or values. -->

## Connect to the container in SSMS

The wizard connects Object Explorer automatically. Use these steps if you need to reconnect or open a separate connection, such as a connection explicitly targeting `master` for provisioning.

1. Start SSMS. Open a Database Engine connection through **Object Explorer** > **Connect** > **Database Engine**.

1. Enter the following connection settings. The layout depends on your SSMS version.

   | Setting | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Server type, if shown | **Database Engine** |
   | Server name | `127.0.0.1,<host-port>`. Replace `<host-port>` with the port shown in Connection String Details. |
   | Authentication | **SQL Server Authentication** |
   | Login | `sa` |
   | Password | The `sa` password you entered in the wizard |
   | Database name / Connect to database | `master` |
   | Encryption | **Mandatory**, or enable **Encrypt connection** in older dialogs |
   | Trust server certificate | Selected |

   In dialogs that don't show the database field on the main page, select **Options** > **Connection Properties** and enter `master` under **Connect to database**. See [Connect to server (Connection Properties page)](../f1-help/connect-to-server-connection-properties-page-database-engine.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Trusting the server certificate bypasses certificate validation for the container's self-signed certificate. Use this setting only for this local development connection. Don't apply it to production Azure SQL Database connections.

1. Select **Connect**. This workflow uses a local endpoint and SQL authentication, not an Azure logical server, Azure firewall rule, or Microsoft Entra sign-in.

1. Open **New Query** for this connection. Confirm that the query targets `master`, then select **Execute** or press **F5** to run:

   ```sql
   SELECT DB_NAME() AS DatabaseName;
   ```

   The result should be `master`. Use this connection only to provision or remove user databases.

## Create a database

Use `TutorialDB` as the example database name. The walkthrough screenshots use `Demo`; substitute your project's database name consistently if you choose another name.

1. In **Object Explorer**, expand the container connection, right-click **Databases**, and select **New Azure SQL Database...**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/new-database-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Databases context menu with New Azure SQL Database selected.":::

1. In **New Azure SQL Database**, enter `TutorialDB` in **Database name**. Review **Collation** and leave it unchanged for this tutorial, then select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/new-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New Azure SQL Database dialog with database name Demo, the collation setting, and OK.":::

1. Wait for creation to complete. Expand **Databases** to find the new database. If it isn't shown, right-click **Databases** and select **Refresh**.

If you prefer T-SQL, instead of using the dialog, open a query on a connection explicitly targeting `master` and run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [TutorialDB];
GO
```

Wait for the command to complete before connecting to `TutorialDB`. If a database with that name already exists, use a different name throughout this quickstart or confirm that the existing database is safe to use. Don't delete an existing database just to repeat the tutorial.

Connecting to a database that doesn't exist doesn't create it. Use `master` for database provisioning and your user database for application queries.

## Connect directly to the new database

1. Open a new Database Engine connection in SSMS with the same server, SQL login, password, encryption, and certificate settings.
1. Enter `TutorialDB` in **Database name** or **Connect to database**, then select **Connect**.
1. Open **New Query** for this new connection and run:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       DB_NAME() AS DatabaseName,
       SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition') AS EngineEdition,
       SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition;
   ```

   Expected results:

   | DatabaseName | EngineEdition | Edition |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | TutorialDB | 5 | SQL Azure |

   If `DatabaseName` isn't `TutorialDB`, open a connection that explicitly targets it before continuing. If `EngineEdition` isn't `5`, check that you started the Azure SQL Database image, not a SQL Server image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Select the database when opening the connection. Don't use `USE` or the query editor database dropdown to switch from `master` for this workflow. A direct user-database connection enforces Azure SQL Database semantics; `USE` to switch databases isn't supported in that session.

## Create a table

In the query window connected directly to `TutorialDB`, run:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Customers
(
    CustomerId int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,
    Location nvarchar(50) NOT NULL
);
GO
```

Keep using this `TutorialDB` connection for the remaining table operations.

## Insert rows

Run the following statement once to add sample data:

```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.Customers (CustomerId, Name, Location)
VALUES
    (1, N'Orlando', N'Australia'),
    (2, N'Keith', N'India'),
    (3, N'Donna', N'Germany'),
    (4, N'Janet', N'United States');
GO
```

## Query the table and view the results

Run:

```sql
SELECT CustomerId, Name, Location
FROM dbo.Customers
ORDER BY CustomerId;
```

SSMS displays four rows in the **Results** pane:

| CustomerId | Name | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Orlando | Australia |
| 2 | Keith | India |
| 3 | Donna | Germany |
| 4 | Janet | United States |

The query window status bar also identifies the server and database. Verify that it shows your local endpoint and `TutorialDB`, not an Azure database used for production.

## Import your schema and data

If you already have a database package, use the SSMS package commands instead of creating the sample table manually.

| Package | What it contains | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.dacpac` | Database schema, without table data | Deploy schema to a development database. |
| `.bacpac` | Database schema and table data | Import schema and data into a new or empty development database. |

To create a database from a package, right-click **Databases** under the container connection and select **Create database from bacpac/dacpac (Preview)**. Review the package and target in the operation's dialog before proceeding.

For an existing user database, right-click the database and select **Tasks**. The menu includes **Apply bacpac/dacpac (Preview)** and **Create bacpac/dacpac (Preview)**. Use the create operation to package schema or schema and data that you want to keep before deleting the container.

:::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/package-operations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a database Tasks menu showing Apply bacpac/dacpac and Create bacpac/dacpac preview commands.":::

Target the local server, host port, and intended user database. Review the target and proposed changes before proceeding, then connect directly to the user database to inspect the result. Don't import a BACPAC into `TutorialDB` after creating the sample table because the database isn't empty.

For command-line workflows, use Azure SQL-compatible [SqlPackage](/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage) [Publish](/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage-publish) or [Import](/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage-import) operations.

SQL Server `.bak` files aren't BACPAC files. `BACKUP DATABASE` and `RESTORE DATABASE` aren't supported by the Azure SQL Database container.

## Connect your application

Use the local endpoint, the wizard's selected host port, your database name, and your credentials with an Azure SQL-compatible driver or object-relational mapper (ORM). For example, this ADO.NET-style connection string targets `TutorialDB`:

```text
Server=127.0.0.1,<host-port>;Database=TutorialDB;User ID=<sql-login>;Password=<password>;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;
```

Replace the placeholders before connecting. `TrustServerCertificate=True` is for the local container's self-signed certificate only. Use certificate validation and an appropriate authentication method for Azure SQL Database in Azure.

Store connection strings in environment variables or your development secret store, not source control or AI prompts. Other drivers use different connection-string syntax. See [Get started with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](/sql/connect/ado-net/get-started-sqlclient-driver).

## Develop with AI

You can use [GitHub Copilot in SSMS](../github-copilot/get-started.md) to explain SQL, draft queries, and plan schema changes against your local database. Review generated SQL and the selected connection before executing it. The local container is free; GitHub Copilot and external model services have their own access and pricing requirements.

After creating `dbo.Customers`, try this prompt:

```text
I'm developing against an Azure SQL Database container.
Use my existing TutorialDB connection. First confirm the active database
and EngineEdition = 5. Explain the dbo.Customers schema, then draft a
parameterized query to insert a customer and a query to list customers.
Don't execute changes, delete data, or create cloud resources.
Don't request or display passwords. Don't use USE to switch databases.
```

For code-first workflows, the [Azure SQL Database container agent skills](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/agent-skills.html) provide setup, connection, migration, and local-to-cloud guidance for supported AI coding agents.

## Troubleshoot connectivity and tooling

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Wizard isn't available | Confirm that your SSMS release includes the Azure SQL Database container wizard and that you're using Windows x64. The ARM workflow isn't supported. |
| Runtime prerequisite check fails | Start the runtime and verify that it's configured for Linux containers, with at least 2 GB of memory and one processor available. Select **Check again** on **Runtime readiness**. For Docker, run `docker info`. |
| Image download fails | Review the wizard's error and check network access and any required image access settings. |
| Container exits or SSMS can't connect after startup | Review provisioning errors and runtime logs for the actual container name. Check the password policy and runtime resources, then retry after the engine is ready. |
| Port is already allocated | Use an available host port during provisioning and the same port in the SSMS connection. |
| Certificate validation fails | For this local self-signed certificate only, enable **Trust server certificate** and keep encryption enabled. |
| Can't open `TutorialDB` | Create the database on a `master` connection first, then open a separate connection directly to `TutorialDB`. |
| `USE` returns error 40508 | Open a new connection that names the target database instead of switching databases within a session. |
| Object Explorer or another graphical feature fails | Check the error against the [known limitations](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/known-limitations.html) for your preview build. The container's bundled `sqlcmd` is an alternative if a graphical feature blocks progress; see [Getting started](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/getting-started.html#step-3-connect-and-run-your-first-query). |

Test your application against Azure SQL Database in the cloud before deploying it; preview restrictions, defaults, and feature support can differ.

## Manage the container lifecycle

You can reconnect to a running container with its local endpoint, user database, and credentials. Stopping the container makes it unavailable to SSMS and your application until it's started again. Deleting a wizard-created container permanently removes the databases stored inside it.

In **Object Explorer**, right-click the container's server connection and select **Container Tasks**. Choose the action you need:

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Start Container** | Start a stopped container. |
| **Stop Container** | Stop the container without deleting its databases. |
| **Restart Container** | Restart the container, temporarily interrupting database connections. |
| **Delete Container** | Remove the container and permanently delete its stored databases. |

:::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-azure-sql-database-container/container-management.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Object Explorer server context menu with Container Tasks showing Start Container, Stop Container, Restart Container, and Delete Container.":::

Actions can be unavailable depending on the container's current state. After starting or restarting, wait for the engine to be ready and reconnect directly to `TutorialDB` using the same credentials. **Disconnect** closes the Object Explorer connection; use **Stop Container** when you want to stop the container itself.

Before deleting the container, use **Tasks** > **Create bacpac/dacpac (Preview)** on each database whose schema or data you need to retain. A schema-only DACPAC doesn't preserve table data. A package doesn't provide the managed backups or recovery services of Azure SQL Database in Azure.

## Clean up resources

To remove the tutorial resources:

1. Export any schema and data you want to keep before deleting the database or container.

1. Close query windows and disconnect SSMS connections to `TutorialDB`.
1. On a connection explicitly targeting `master`, run the following only if `TutorialDB` is the database you created for this tutorial:

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE [TutorialDB];
   GO
   ```

1. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the tutorial container's server connection and select **Container Tasks** > **Delete Container**.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Removing the wizard-created container permanently deletes all databases stored inside it, not only `TutorialDB`. Make sure you have exported any data you need from other databases before continuing.

Stopping the container preserves it for a later session; removing it deletes its stored databases. The local container doesn't provide the managed backup, high availability, or recovery services of Azure SQL Database in the cloud.
